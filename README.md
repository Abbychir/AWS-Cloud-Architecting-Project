# AWS-Cloud-Architecting-Project
A repository for the final capstone project of the AWS Academy Cloud Architecting Course

Hereâ€™s a **Markdown rubric** for this `README.md` file tailored to the Capstone Project final submission. This rubric will guide learners on structuring a comprehensive and professional `README.md` for your project repositories.


## Introduction  
### 1. Project Title  
- Provide a clear, descriptive, and professional title for your project.  

**Example:**  
`Cloud Architecting Capstone Project: Scalable High Availabity E-commerce Application`

---

### 2. Project Overview  
- Summarize the project in 2-3 sentences. Include the purpose, high-level functionality, and key AWS services used.  

**Checklist:**  
- [ ] What problem does this project solve?  
- [ ] Why is this solution important?  
- [ ] What is the primary AWS architecture implemented?

---

## Architecture Diagram  
- Include a detailed architecture diagram of your solution. You can use tools like **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, or **AWS Architecture Diagramming Tool**.  

**Checklist:**  
- [ ] Does the diagram include all key components (e.g., VPC, subnets, load balancers, EC2 instances, S3 buckets)?  
- [ ] Are security services like IAM roles, security groups, and KMS indicated?  
- [ ] Is the flow of data/workload clearly illustrated?  

---

## Features and Functionality  
### 1. Key Features  
- List and briefly describe the primary features of your project.  

**Example:**  
- `Autoscaling`: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on traffic.  
- `Highly Available`: Built using multi-AZ deployment.  
- `Cost Optimization`: Utilizes AWS pricing models such as Reserved Instances or Spot Instances.  

### 2. AWS Services Used  
- Provide a list of AWS services with a short explanation of their role in the project.  

**Example:**  
- `Amazon S3`: Stores static assets like images and files.  
- `Amazon RDS`: Hosts the relational database for the application.

---

## Deployment  
### 1. Prerequisites  
- List any software, tools, or AWS configurations required to deploy the project.  

**Example:**  
- `AWS CLI` installed and configured.  
- IAM user with admin privileges.  

### 2. Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions  
- Provide a clear, concise set of steps for deploying the project.  

**Checklist:**  
- [ ] Include instructions for launching CloudFormation templates or Terraform scripts (if applicable).  
- [ ] Detail any manual configurations in the AWS Management Console.  

---

## Security  
- Describe security measures implemented in your architecture.  

**Example:**  
- `IAM Roles`: Restrict access to resources based on least privilege.  
- `Encryption`: S3 bucket encryption using SSE-KMS.  
- `Network Security`: Configured security groups and NACLs.  

---

## Testing and Validation  
### 1. Testing Strategy  
- Describe how the project was tested, including tools used (e.g., Postman, AWS CloudWatch Logs).  

**Checklist:**  
- [ ] What tests were conducted (e.g., load testing, failover testing)?  
- [ ] Include commands, test cases, or examples.  

---

## Challenges and Learnings  
- Reflect on any challenges faced during implementation and what you learned from them.  

**Example:**  
- Challenge: Setting up an ALB to route traffic between subnets.  
- Learning: Gained hands-on experience with cross-zone load balancing.  

---

## Future Improvements  
- Suggest potential upgrades or optimizations for the project.  

**Example:**  
- Implement CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline.  
- Enhance monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch Insights.

---

## Contributors  
- List team members and their contributions.  

**Example:**  
`Jane Doe - Architecture Design, Documentation`  
`John Smith - Deployment, Security Configuration`

---

## License  
- Include licensing information for your project (if applicable).  

**Example:**
